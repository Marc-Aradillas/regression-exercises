# Regression Exercises

Welcome to the Regression Exercises repository! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the application of supervised machine learning techniques for regression analysis. Regression allows us to model relationships between one or more features (independent variables) and a target variable.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide hands-on examples and insights into the data science pipeline using regression techniques. By exploring these exercises, you'll gain a better understanding of how to:

*Prepare and preprocess data for regression analysis.
*Select appropriate regression algorithms for different scenarios.
*Train and evaluate regression models.
*Interpret and visualize the results of regression analyses.

## Contents

This repository contains:

- **Code Examples:** Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating regression techniques.

- **Datasets:** Sample datasets used in the exercises, enabling you to replicate and practice the analyses.

- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the concepts, methods, and interpretations involved in regression.

- **Resources:** Additional resources, such as relevant research papers and links to external tutorials.
